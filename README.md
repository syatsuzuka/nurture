# üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶NURTURE 
<i> The easiest way to help tutors engage with students and guide their progress. </i>

## Background
Nurture was an idea that developed from a real life tennis tutor friend that was having difficulty in maintaining records for his students, especially because all their feedback was written on paper forms. He really needed a way to properly maintain all feedback, visually see the data on his students lesson improvement over time, and communicate with his students one-on-one. The Nurture team then set about to create a platform with a primary focus for helping tennis tutors teach their students more effectively by seeing their progress on a chart and allocating more homework in the areas they were struggling.
